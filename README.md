# Financial App README

This financial app is a data-driven application that provides forecasting and analysis of cryptocurrencies. It is currently in the development phase and is being built using Python, Django, API, and MindsDB.

## Features

The financial app aims to provide the following features:

- Cryptocurrency Data: The app fetches real-time cryptocurrency data using APIs and stores it in a database for analysis and forecasting.

- Forecasting: The app utilizes the MindsDB library, a machine learning tool, to create predictive models for forecasting cryptocurrency prices. These models are trained on historical data and are used to generate forecasts for future price trends.

- Analysis: The app performs various statistical and technical analysis on cryptocurrency data, such as calculating moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and other indicators to provide insights into price trends and market behavior.

- Visualization: The app uses data visualization techniques to present the forecasted and analyzed data in graphical form, such as line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts, to make it easier for users to interpret and understand the information.

## Technology Stack
The financial app is being developed using the following technologies:

- Python: A powerful programming language that is widely used in data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is used to implement the backend logic and data processing tasks.

- Django: A popular web framework for Python that provides tools for building web applications efficiently. It is used to develop the server-side components of the app, handle user authentication, and manage database operations.

- API: Application Programming Interface (API) is used to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data from external sources, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, and integrate it into the app.

- MindsDB: An open-source machine learning tool that simplifies the process of building and deploying predictive models. It is used to train and generate forecasts for cryptocurrency prices.
