## Features

The financial app aims to provide the following features:

- Navigation: This application includes a fixed navigation menu, so the user may navigate the app from any page

- Landing/Home Page (main content will go here)

- Cryptocurrency Data: The app fetches real-time cryptocurrency data using APIs and stores it in a dataset (CSV file) for analysis and forecasting.

- Forecasting: The app utilizes the MindsDB library, a machine learning tool, to create predictive models for forecasting cryptocurrency prices. These models are trained on historical data and are used to generate forecasts for future price trends.

- Analysis: The app performs various statistical and technical analysis on cryptocurrency data, such as calculating moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and other indicators to provide insights into price trends and market behavior.

- Visualization: The app uses data visualization techniques to present the forecasted and analyzed data in graphical form, such as line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts, to make it easier for users to interpret and understand the information.
